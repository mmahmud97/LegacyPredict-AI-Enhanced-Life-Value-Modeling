# LegacyPredict-AI-Enhanced-Life-Value-Modeling

LegacyPredict is an advanced lifetime value (LTV) model that leverages transactional data from established customer groups to forecast the behavior of newer customers. By analyzing patterns within "legacy" customer data, LegacyPredict offers more accurate, data-driven insights into potential customer value trajectories. This pre-processed data is then integrated into a sophisticated statistical model for enhanced LTV predictions.
